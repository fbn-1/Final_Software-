But if you're talking and you need supply chain, Workday falls off the table and now you're in the game with SAP. And then if you're talking services with SAP, not a great product. If you're talking products, now you've got a real battle on your hands based on what that product is geared towards. So there's not a lot of major technology players at this space.

So if you talk about Workday, you're talking about a product that's pretty decent in the finance, comparable to financials and human capital management, right? That's Workday's bread and butter. But if you're talking and you need supply chain, Workday falls off the table and now you're in the game with SAP. And then if you're talking services with SAP, not a great product. You're talking products. Now you've got a real battle on your hands based on what that product is geared towards. So there's not a lot of major technology players at this space. There's some OneStream and a few other places that play in some smaller end of those products and they're starting to add on and try to make themselves a more enterprise product. But yeah, there's not a lot of handful of competitors that can go as wide and deep as Oracle. So it's a decent rock fight with a few people. Okay, and before we go into the product level detail, can you give us a sense year to date how you've seen Oracle's go to market their sales force change? Either they're really happy and did it properly. There's restructuring. Yeah, and we just passed what we refer to as the summer shuffle in June, where they end their year, they promote people, they remove people, they realign. All those things just happened a month ago. So we're still sifting through all that. For the most part, the channel has been great. The sales vibes have been positive. The year has been good. And Oracle has had a lot of good fuel on the fire between Stargate and getting chosen there and a variety of things. And they're leading AI marketplace expansions in ERP and things like that. There's a lot of good stories to tell on a routine basis this year, which is helping. Because if we went back two years ago, AI wasn't a question, it wasn't a thing. Now it's part of the table.	2025-09-12 11:16:13.531939
3	chunk_002.mp4	So you're going to continue to see those advancements be available for upsell in the marketplace, right? A lot of people, when they get an ERP, they have a product called Fusion Analytics Warehouse. They just changed the name on it, so I forget what they changed it to. But there's a lot of bolt-on functionality. Once you get the core modules knocked down and locked down, there's a lot of things you can add on to continue going. The other thing that's really important to understand, when you were on-prem and you bought a 1,000-user license and you drifted to 2,000 users, you drifted to 2,000 users. Unless Oracle caught you in an audit or you went back and bought it yourself, the Oracle was consistently chasing that revenue on-prem because they had no way to stop it from running, nor did they want to do that. When you're in the cloud, though, it's key to understand that every single user that you provision, every single CPU, memory, gig of space, all of those things that you turn on, PaaS packages, all of those things, build day one and don't stop. The revenue recognition is much faster in cloud and it's much truer, and there's no true-up chasing you in the cloud. So that's where you're starting to see that revenue start to scale, is that they're catching it all right out of the gate every month. Yes, I think you heard Saffron, I think it was Saffron on the call, say we can turn $10 billion of database support revenue into $50 billion of cloud revenue. Yep. This is essentially what you're saying. Can you describe, as it stands right now, the Oracle sales motion inside the enterprise? How top-down is it? What are the top-level conversations you have when you're first starting out? And how has that changed over the past couple of years? For us, it's the ever-consistent embedding ourselves in the channel and getting into those deals, getting into the swing further back in the process. It's great if you've sold the product and you bring us in as an implementer, but we usually tend to add a lot of value as far up in the beginning, and we like to try to partner as soon as you start talking cloud. A lot of times, because our services, after your initial cloud is, your cloud purchase, we're 2x, 3x that cost. You're spending $500,000, we're a million plus. So a lot of times, partners nowadays are like, yeah, I understand what the cloud costs, but I want to understand the partner and I want to understand that expense. So we've made a conscious effort to partner as quick as we can in the process to start to add that value and to get that technology still. Because in the enterprise, it's not always they're going with Oracle no matter what. There is a technology bake-off that happens. We found that getting in as early as possible, adding that value, letting them know that in your vertical and your particular niche business, we've done this 25 times, and here's what you need to know, here's what you learned, here's what the advantages are, is a great sales tactic for us and it works very well.

Yes, I think you heard Saffron, I think it was Saffron on the call, say we can turn 10 billion of database support revenue into 50 billion of cloud revenue. Yep. This is essentially what you're saying. Can you describe, as it stands right now, the Oracle sales motion inside the enterprise? How top-down is it? What are the top-level conversations you have when you're first starting out? And how has that changed over the past couple of years? For us, it's the ever-consistent embedding ourselves in the channel and getting into those deals, getting into the swing further back in the process. It's great if you've sold the product and you bring us in as an implementer, but we usually tend to add a lot of value as far up in the beginning, and we like to try to partner as soon as you start talking cloud. A lot of times, because our services, after your initial cloud is, your cloud purchase, we're 2x, 3x that cost. You're spending 500,000, we're a million plus. So a lot of times, partners nowadays are like, yeah, I understand what the cloud costs, but I want to understand the partner and I want to understand that expense. So we've made a conscious effort to partner as quick as we can in the process to start to add that value and to get that technology still. Because in the enterprise, it's not always, they're going with Oracle no matter what. There is a technology bake-off that happens. So we found that getting in as early as possible, adding that value, letting them know that in your vertical and your particular niche business, we've done this 25 times, and here's what you need to know. Here's what you learned. Here's what the advantages are is a great sales tactic for us. It works very well. So our deal is all about working with the channel and getting into the channel as deep as we can, as wide as we can across the whole ecosystem. But if ERP is the anchor, ERP replatforming is the anchor, who's the real competition that you're seeing at that point? Yeah, well, you're talking about Workday, okay? So if you talk about Workday, you're talking about a product that's pretty decent in the finance, comparable to financials and human capital management, right? That's Workday's bread and butter. But if you're talking and you need supply chain, Workday falls off the table and now you're in the game with SAP. And then if you're talking services with SAP, not a great product. You're talking products. Now you've got a real battle on your hands based on what that product is geared towards. So there's not a lot of major technology players at this space. There's some OneStream and a few other places that play in some smaller end of those products and they're starting to add on and try to make themselves a more enterprise product. But yeah, there's not a lot of handful of competitors that can go as wide and deep as Oracle. So it's a decent rock fight with a few people. Okay, and before we go into the product level detail, can you give us a sense year to date how you've seen Oracle's go to market their sales force change? Either they're really happy and did it properly. There's restructuring. Yeah, and we just passed what we refer to as the summer shuffle in June, where they end their year, they promote people, they remove people, they realign. All those things just happened a month ago. So we're still sifting through all that. For the most part, the channel has been great. The sales vibes have been positive. The year has been good. And Oracle has had a lot of good fuel on the fire between Stargate and getting chosen there and a variety of things. And they're leading AI marketplace expansions in ERP and things like that. There's a lot of good stories to tell on a routine basis this year, which is helping. Because if we went back two years ago, AI wasn't a question, it wasn't a thing. Now it's part of the table.	2025-09-12 14:45:33.034334
17	chunk_002.mp4	So you're going to continue to see those advancements be available for upsell in the marketplace, right? A lot of people, when they get an ERP, they have a product called Fusion Analytics Warehouse. They just changed the name on it, so I forget what they changed it to. But there's a lot of bolt-on functionality. Once you get the core modules knocked down and locked down, there's a lot of things you can add on to continue going. The other thing that's really important to understand, when you were on-prem and you bought a 1,000-user license and you drifted to 2,000 users, you drifted to 2,000 users. Unless Oracle caught you in an audit or you went back and bought it yourself, the Oracle was consistently chasing that revenue on-prem because they had no way to stop it from running, nor did they want to do that. When you're in the cloud, though, it's key to understand that every single user that you provision, every single CPU, memory, gig of space, all of those things that you turn on, PaaS packages, all of those things, build day one and don't stop. The revenue recognition is much faster in cloud and it's much truer, and there's no true-up chasing you in the cloud. So that's where you're starting to see that revenue start to scale, is that they're catching it all right out of the gate every month.
